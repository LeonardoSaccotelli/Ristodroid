# Ristodroid
Development of a native Android application in the catering sector. The project involves the creation of two applications for the customer and the waiter respectively.
Through the application intended for the customer, installed on devices supplied with the restaurant, you can consult the menu, add and remove dishes from the order, view the bill if available, view and insert reviews for a particular dish. Once the order is completed, the customer will confirm by sending the order to the waiter's application via NFC.
The waiter can view and change the order, enter the table number, the number of seats, the type of covers and any additional notes. At this point the order will be confirmed and sent.
Project developed during the Mobile Software Development course @ [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uniba.it/ricerca/dipartimenti/informatica) @ [University of Bari "Aldo Moro"](http://www.uniba.it/) under the supervision of dr. [Paolo Buono](http://ivu.di.uniba.it/people/buono.htm).
